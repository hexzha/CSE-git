Introduction to Git

## Motivation

Git is a version control system that was created to help developers
track changes in code and manage collaborative project.
Just as you might write several drafts of an English paper, a
programmer might write several drafts of a program. Git keeps
track of which draft is which, and also makes it easy to share the
files with others.

Git helps use: 
- Compare versions to locate changes or bugs
- rollback to previous versions of files as necessary
- store multiple versions of a file
- merge versions and resolve conflicts that arise from collaboration
